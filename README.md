The code implements a symptom checker application using Python's Tkinter library for GUI, where users can select symptoms from a list to evaluate potential diseases and their severity levels. The app features a dataset of diseases categorized by stages (e.g., mild, severe) and their associated symptoms. Upon selecting symptoms, the app matches them to diseases and provides recommendations, classified into three levels: "Might Need Action," "Highly Recommended Action," and "Urgent Action Needed." It also visualizes the results in a bar graph, showing the severity levels of each matched disease, making it interactive and informative for health guidance purposes. The modular design ensures scalability and easy integration with additional data.
